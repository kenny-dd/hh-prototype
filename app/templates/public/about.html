                            Government agencies and charities fall short of effectively collaborating, sharing data, 
                            conveying important information and staying current with situations that affect at-risk members of the public. 
                            At-risk individuals give up on help when those organizations either lack clarity, lack accountability, seem confusing 
                            or remain entirely unknown.

                                The Helping Hands platform will aim to simplify the process of connecting those in need with the appropriate 
                                resources by discovering the userâ€™s specific circumstances and tailoring a unique solution for their dilemma.
